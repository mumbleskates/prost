/// A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented as a count of seconds and
/// fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts
/// like "day" or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between two Timestamp
/// values is a Duration.
///
/// Values of this type are not guaranteed to only exist in their normalized form.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.
///
/// ```text
/// Timestamp start = ...;
/// Timestamp end = ...;
/// Duration duration = ...;
///
/// duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds;
/// duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;
///
/// if (duration.seconds < 0 && duration.nanos > 0) {
///    duration.seconds += 1;
///    duration.nanos -= 1000000000;
/// } else if (duration.seconds > 0 && duration.nanos < 0) {
///    duration.seconds -= 1;
///    duration.nanos += 1000000000;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.
///
/// ```text
/// Timestamp start = ...;
/// Duration duration = ...;
/// Timestamp end = ...;
///
/// end.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds;
/// end.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;
///

///    end.nanos += 1000000000;
/// } else if (end.nanos >= 1000000000) {
///    end.seconds += 1;
///    end.nanos -= 1000000000;
