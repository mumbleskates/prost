//! These are the modules where we stash the impls for the supported types. Many common types that
//! are found in the language may be supported by multiple encoders, and so they have a lot of their
//! actual encoding implementations in their respective encoding modules (like encoding::general,
//! encoding::plain_bytes, etc.). Those types still have common definitions of what constitutes an
//! "empty" value, or they may implement different types of homogenous collections, so those parts
//! of their implementations are found here, in the always-enabled modules.
//!
//! Third-party types are conditionally enabled by feature, and all of the associated functionality
//! that we provide is defined in each of those modules, including for std.
